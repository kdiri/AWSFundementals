## Cost Management on AWS Notes

------

AWS uses a *pay-as-you-go* pricing model. This allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without over-committing budgets, and it improves your responsiveness to changes. General pricing information can be found at: https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/.

As mentioned in the segment on Regions, AWS pricing varies by Region. When you explore costs, make sure that you select the appropriate Region.

Pricing for each service can be found on the AWS website under the specific service listing. For example, Amazon EC2 pricing can be found at: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/. The price for Amazon S3 can be found at: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/.

## AWS Pricing Calculator

AWS has announced a new pricing tool, the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/). This new tool, which is currently in beta, can be used to calculate Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS pricing. For further information about this tool, see [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/check-it-out-new-aws-pricing-calculator-for-ec2-and-ebs/). For other services, you can use the [AWS Simple Monthly Calculator.](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

## AWS Cost Explorer

[AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. You can create custom reports (including charts and tabular data) that analyze cost and usage data, both at a high level (e.g., total costs and usage across all accounts) and for highly specific requests (e.g., m2.2xlarge costs within account Y that are tagged **project: secretProject**).
