## Compliance

We include services in the scope of our compliance efforts based on the expected use case, feedback and demand. If a service is not currently listed as in scope of the most recent assessment, it does not mean that you cannot use the service. It is part of the [shared responsibility](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) for your organization to determine the nature of the data. Based on the nature of what you are building on AWS, you should determine if the service will process or store customer data and how it will or will not impact the compliance of your customer data environment.
